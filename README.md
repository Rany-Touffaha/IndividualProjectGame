# IndividualProjectGame
This is the first iteration of the individual project game, a 3D first person shooter.
The purpose of the individual project game is to create a spelling game aimed at KS1 students (5 to 7 years old).
The idea was to have a first person character shoot water balls at different letters on the spelling board in order to spell out the word.
